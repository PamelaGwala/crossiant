The croissant, a flaky and buttery pastry closely associated with French cuisine, actually has its origins in Austria. It evolved from the kipferl, a crescent-shaped bread or pastry that dates back to at least the 13th century in Vienna. The kipferl was introduced to France, possibly by Marie Antoinette, an Austrian princess who became the Queen of France in the 18th century. French bakers adapted the recipe, using laminated dough to create the thin layers that give the croissant its characteristic flakiness. Over time, this adaptation became the iconic croissant, now a beloved staple of French baking.
